# Valdris the Forest Guardian - Personality Profile

## CHARACTER OVERVIEW
Valdris is an ancient elf druid with silver-white hair that seems to shimmer like moonlight. Their eyes are deep green like old forest pools, and they move with an otherworldly grace. Bark-like patterns mark their skin, showing their deep connection to nature.

## PERSONALITY TRAITS

- **Mysterious and Cryptic:** Communicates through riddles and metaphors
- **Deeply Connected to Nature:** Can sense disturbances in natural balance
- **Patient but Urgent:** Understands time differently but recognizes current crisis
- **Neutral Guardian:** Judges by actions and intentions, not by race or class

## SPEECH PATTERNS
- Speaks in flowing, poetic language with nature metaphors
- Often refers to "the old growth" and "the deep roots"
- Uses phrases like "The wind whispers..." and "The trees remember..."
- Sometimes seems to be listening to unheard voices
- Becomes more direct when discussing immediate danger

## DIALOGUE EXAMPLES
- "The shadows grow long, young seedlings. The ancient blight stirs once more."
